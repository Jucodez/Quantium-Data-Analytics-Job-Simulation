# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Job-Simulation

## Introduction

The job simulation was centered around performing a customer segmentation analysis on chip purchases for a supermarket chain and carrying out A/B testing to examine the effect of a new store layout on store performance.

The job simulation was broken down into three tasks:

- Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics
- Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing
- Task 3: Analytics and commercial application

## Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics

This task aimed at analyzing the transaction dataset provided by a supermarket chain (client) and identifying customer purchasing behaviors to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

Activities:

- Clean transaction and customer data.
- Analyze various customer segments to determine their contribution to chip sales.
- Perform further analysis to understand why they contribute what they do to chip sales.
- Carry out product category analysis to identify preferences of key customer segments.

## Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing

This task aimed at extending the analysis from Task 1 to help the client understand the effect of the experimental store layout on store performance.

Activities:

- Clean transaction and customer data.
- Identify control stores with performance similar to that of trial stores before the experimental layout was adopted.
- Perform comparative analysis on trial and control stores to understand the effect of the experimental store layout on store performance.


## Task 3: Analytics and commercial application

This task involved preparing a presentation slide for the client with regard to the analysis carried out in tasks 1 and 2. This slide would help to present key insights discovered.
