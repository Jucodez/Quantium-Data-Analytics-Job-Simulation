# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Job-Simulation

## Introduction

The job simulation was centered around performing a customer segmentation analysis on chip purchases for a supermarket chain and carrying out A/B testing to examine the effect of a new store layout on store performance.

The job simulation was broken down into three tasks:

- Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics
- Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing
- Task 3: Analytics and commercial application

## Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics

This task aimed at analyzing the transaction dataset provided by a supermarket chain (client) and identifying customer purchasing behaviors to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

Activities:

- Clean transaction and customer data.
- Analyze various customer segments to determine their contribution to chip sales.
- Perform further analysis to understand why they contribute what they do to chip sales.
- Carry out product category analysis to identify preferences of key customer segments.

## Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing

This task aimed at extending the analysis from Task 1 to help the client understand the effect of the experimental store layout on store performance.

Activities:

- Clean transaction and customer data.
- Identify control stores with performance similar to that of trial stores before the experimental layout was adopted.
- Perform comparative analysis on trial and control stores to understand the effect of the experimental store layout on store performance.


## Task 3: Analytics and commercial application

This task involved preparing a presentation slide for the client with regard to the analysis carried out in tasks 1 and 2. This slide would help to present key insights discovered.

## Insights

### Task 1

1. The top 3 customer segments responsible for sales are:
- budget older families
- mainstream retirees
- mainstream young singles and couples
2. The number of customers is the driver of sales in the mainstream retirees and mainstream young singles/couples segments.
3. The number of chips purchased per customer is the driver of sales in the budget older families segments.



### Task 2

1. With stores 77, 86, and 88 as trial stores, stores 233, 155, and 237 were selected as control stores, respectively.
2. The experimental store layout positively affected the performance of stores 77 and 88, but this was not the case for store 86.
